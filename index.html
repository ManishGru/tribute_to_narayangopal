        <h2>Childhood and Early life</h2>
        <p id="earlylife">
            Narayan Gopal Guruwacharya was born into a Newar family in Kilagal Tole, Kathmandu, on October 4, 1939
            (18 Asoj, 1996 B.S.) to Asha Gopal Guruwacharya (father) and Ram Devi Guruwacharya (mother). He had six
            brothers and four sisters. He completed School Leaving Certificate (SLC) in 2016 B.S. and obtained a
            Bachelor of Arts degree in Humanities from Tri-Chandra College. He also went to Maharaja Sayajirao
            University of Baroda in India to study Indian classical music but returned to Nepal without completing
            his studies. He married Pemala Lama in 1971.
        </p>
        <h2>Career Life</h2>
        <p>
            The potential of his vocal talent was first recognized by his friend "Manik Ratna Sthapit", who lived in
            the neighboring Pyukha Tole, and Prem Dhoj Pradhan, who lived in Bheda Singh Tole. Prem-Manik duo had
            started to sing their own compositions. Following suit, Narayan Gopal composed six original songs
            written by the contemporary poet Ratna Shumsher Thapa. In that collection four of the songs were for
            solo vocal ('स्वर्गकी रानी', 'आँखाको भाखा आँखैले', 'भो भो मलाई नछेक', 'मधुमासमा यो दिल') and two were
            for duet ('बिछोडको पीडा' र 'ए कान्छा ठट्टैमा यो बैंश जानलाग्यो'). All these songs were eventually
            recorded in Kolkata, India, while he was in that country for his studies. These songs started to attract
            attention within Nepal and India.
        </p>
        <p>With the partnership of a famous composer and lyricist Gopal Yonzon during the later sixties, Narayan
            Gopal's music entered a new phase in which he began to write about love, loss and tragedy. In the words
            of Ishwar Bhallav, Narayan Gopal became the singer of the hearts of the Nepali people. Rafi's
            association with Gopal Yonzon helped Narayan Gopal establish himself as one of the most prominent
            singers in Nepali music history.Song like बिर्सेर फेरि मलाई नहेर, चिनारी हाम्रो धेरै पुरानो, तिम्रो
            जस्तो मुटु मेरो पनि, लौ सुन म भन्छु मेरो रामकहानी not only gave new lease of life to Gopal Yonzon's
            musical career, but it also carved a special niche for Narayan Gopal among the listeners of Nepali
            music.
        </p>
        <p>After partition with Gopal Yonzon , Narayan Gopal started to work with composer and lyricist Dibya
            Khaling, they created some harmonious songs like "Sadhain Nai Ma Hasen Timilai Ruwai", "Bipana Nabhai
            Banchidine Ma Bhitraka Mera Sapana", "Mayako Aadharma Samjhauta Nai Hunchha", "Jata Hindyo UHeren" tai
            Tanne Baimani yo Maya", " Mero Sano Sansar Timilai Atena", " Yo Bhagyale Kasto Khel Manisako Jiwanma Her
            Kheleko", "Jati Samma Bato Hindisake M Bhanchhu Merai Prayas Ho", "Priyasiko Yaadharu Koriyeko
            Mutu,Ekantma Aaj Yahan Phookayer Heren", "Timilai Bhulda Ma Eklo Parechhu,Timilai Samjhen Timi Yaad
            Aayau", and " Ma Ta Laliguraans Bhayechhu".
        </p>
        <p>Later in his life he started to collaborate with new breed of songwriters such as "Khyetra Pratap
            Adhikari", "Kali Prasad Rijal", "Norden Rumba", "Dinesh Adhikari", and "Bishwambhar Pyaukurel", while
            his relationship with his old collaborators was neglected. Among the composers of the new generation, he
            collaborated with the likes of Sambhujit Baskota, "Bhupendra Rayamajhi", and "Shubha Bahadur". In total
            his career spanned twenty-eight years, during which he sang in eighteen movies and recorded more than
            one hundred and fifty-seven songs.
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
            Gopal was urged by friends to quit smoking and drinking in the interests of his health. He quit drinking
            a few months before he died, but was unable to quit cigarettes. Narayan Gopal died from complications of
            diabetes on December 5, 1990 (19 Mangsir, 2047 B.S.) in Bir Hospital, at 9 p.m. in Kathmandu, at the age
            of 51. He had no children. After the death of Gopal, there were a number of music festivals that were
            created dedicated to Gopal.
        </p>
        <h2>Musical Style</h2>
        <p>
            To Narayan Gopal, the most important part in the art of modern songs were: melody, lyrics, and the
            singer. This did not rule out other aspects, however. Chords, he said, are required to put life in the
            music, but the chord progression is part of the arrangement, not something to base the composition of
            the melody on. When the melody is composed, the arranger will make the progression from the melody.
            Without a good arrangement, Narayan Gopal said, a song will be like a vegetable dish without salt or
            other spices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aspects of this recipe at work included non repetitive melodies moving over the accompaniment in
            short, repeated rhythmic figures; heterophony, countermelodies, chords, and harmonic progressions; one
            melody for refrain, another for the verse, and then—as part of the arrangement—melodies for the
            instrumental interludes marking off the sung sections.
